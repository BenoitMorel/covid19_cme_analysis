here, I refined the two trees from the paper by moving the legend a bit, so that there is more space for the actual tree figure,
and also added a third tree based on Dimitrios lineages for each taxon in the tree.
the cpp script to create the latter needs genesis commit d558ccc9dffdc6e684cd4e7d43820a2ce9827de2 (currently on misc branch, commited 2020-11-12) or later.
